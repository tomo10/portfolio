defmodule Portfolio.Accounts.NotificationSubscriptions do
  # Every time a user receives a notification of some kind (mainly emails), then they should be able to opt out (except for transactional emails like confirming your account).
  # A common case is marketing emails like product updates - a user should be able to unsubscribe from this.
  # In this module we keep list/0 up to date with the types of notifications a user can sub/unsub from.
  # unsubscribe_url/2 will generate a url for a user to unsub from a particular notification type.
  # eg unsubscribe_url(user, "marketing_notifications") will generate a URL for that user to unsubscribe from marketing emails.
  # These urls are then placed at the bottom of emails for easy unsubscribing.
